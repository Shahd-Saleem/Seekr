# Seekr 🔎

## Project Overview

Seekr is a campus-focused Lost & Found Management System developed to streamline the reporting, tracking, and retrieval of misplaced items within a university environment.

The system provides a centralized digital platform where students and faculty can report lost or found items, search listings efficiently, and manage item status through a structured and database-driven web application.

## Academic Context

Seekr was developed as a team-based project for the Software Engineering course.  

The project emphasized system design principles, modular architecture, database integration, and collaborative software development practices.

## Project Timeline

🗓 Development Period: September 2025 – December 2025  

The system was designed, implemented, tested, and documented collaboratively during this academic semester.

## Problem Statement

Lost items on campus are often reported through informal and unstructured channels, making recovery inefficient. Seekr addresses this problem by providing a centralized, organized platform for item reporting and search functionality within the campus community.

## Key Features

###  Item Reporting System
- Submit lost or found item listings  
- Categorize items for structured organization  
- Add detailed descriptions for identification  

###  Search & Filtering Engine
- Keyword-based search functionality  
- Category and status filtering  
- Dynamic display of item listings  

###  Item Status Management
- Update item status (Lost / Found / Claimed)  
- Structured item tracking system  

## Technical Implementation

- Backend logic for request handling and item management  
- Relational database for persistent storage of item records  
- Structured data model for efficient retrieval and categorization  
- Modular architecture following software engineering principles  
- Dynamic content rendering between frontend and backend layers  

## Technologies Used

- Java
- SQL
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and role-based access  
- Image upload for item verification  
- Notification system for matched items  
- Administrative dashboard  
- Campus-wide analytics reporting  

## Project Contribution

Developed collaboratively with shared responsibilities across system design, backend implementation, database modeling, and frontend development.
